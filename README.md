# old_file_purge

Just make sure to replace "/path/to/directory" with the actual path to the directory where you want to delete the files.

After providing the correct directory path, you can execute the script. It will delete the files in the specified directory that are older than six months (based on the modification time).

Remember to uncomment the desired timedelta line (e.g., six_months_ago, one_week_ago, or one_year_ago) based on the desired time period for file deletion.

Please exercise caution when using this script, as it will permanently delete files. Ensure that you have appropriate backups in place or test it on a non-production directory.
